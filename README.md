My name is Taneesh Amin, and I am a Freshman Student who is planning on majoring in Computer Science and/or Data Science with minors with Business Administration and Sport Management. 

Combining all my interests, I often look at NBA data, specifically on the website Basketball Reference. 

Basketball Reference does a phenomenal job keeping data up to date for the NBA while making it accessible in CSV form. While they do not make any models or analyses themselves, their raw data gives me the ability to do so. Given this, I knew for my Data Blog I wanted to focus on the NBA.
